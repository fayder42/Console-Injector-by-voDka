# Where I can take my PID?
1. Open the Task Manager. To do this, you can use the context menu of the Start button, press Ctrl+Shift+Esc, or use the Ctrl+Alt+Delete menu;
2. Switch to the "Details" tab (in Windows 11, switching is performed in the menu) or "Details" (in Windows 10);
3. Pay attention to the "Process ID" column â€” this is the desired PID.
